config DM_ETH
	bool "Enable Driver Model for Ethernet drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for Ethernet.

	  The eth_*() interface will be implemented by the UC_ETH class
	  This is currently implemented in net/eth.c
	  Look in include/net.h for details.

menuconfig NETDEVICES
	bool "Network device support"
	depends on NET
	default y if DM_ETH
	help
	  You must select Y to enable any network device support
	  Generally if you have any networking support this is a given

	  If unsure, say Y

if NETDEVICES

config ETH_SANDBOX
	depends on DM_ETH && SANDBOX
	default y
	bool "Sandbox: Mocked Ethernet driver"
	help
	  This driver simply responds with fake ARP replies and ping
	  replies that are used to verify network stack functionality

	  This driver is particularly useful in the test/dm/eth.c tests

config ETH_SANDBOX_RAW
	depends on DM_ETH && SANDBOX
	default y
	bool "Sandbox: Bridge to Linux Raw Sockets"
	help
	  This driver is a bridge from the bottom of the network stack
	  in U-Boot to the RAW AF_PACKET API in Linux. This allows real
	  network traffic to be tested from within sandbox. See
	  board/sandbox/README.sandbox for more details.

config ETH_DESIGNWARE
	bool "Synopsys Designware Ethernet MAC"
	help
	  This MAC is present in SoCs from various vendors. It supports
	  100Mbit and 1 Gbit operation. You must enable CONFIG_PHYLIB to
	  provide the PHY (physical media interface).
