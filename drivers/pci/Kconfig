config DM_PCI
	bool "Enable driver mode for PCI"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Use driver model for PCI. Driver model is the new method for
	  orgnising devices in U-Boot. For PCI, driver model keeps track of
	  available PCI devices, allows scanning of PCI buses and provides
	  device configuration support.

config PCI_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox PCI support"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM_PCI
	help
	  Support PCI on sandbox, as an emulated bus. This permits testing of
	  PCI feature such as bus scanning, device configuration and device
	  access. The available (emulated) devices are defined statically in
	  the device tree but the normal PCI scan technique is used to find
	  then.
