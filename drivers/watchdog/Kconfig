	bool "Enable BCM2835/2836 watchdog driver"
	select HW_WATCHDOG
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the BCM2835/2836 watchdog

	  This provides basic infrastructure to support BCM2835/2836 watchdog
	  hardware, with a max timeout of ~15secs.

config OMAP_WATCHDOG
	bool "TI OMAP watchdog driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	select HW_WATCHDOG
	default y if AM33XX
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the OMAP3+ watchdog driver.
	
config ULP_WATCHDOG
	bool "i.MX7ULP watchdog"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable i.MX7ULP watchdog driver.

config WDT
	bool "Enable driver model for watchdog timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for watchdog timer. At the moment the API
	  is very simple and only supports four operations:
	  start, restart, stop and reset (expire immediately).
	  What exactly happens when the timer expires is up to a particular
	  device/driver.

config WDT_SANDBOX
	bool "Enable Watchdog Timer support for Sandbox"
	depends on SANDBOX && WDT
	help
		Enable Watchdog Timer support in Sandbox. This is a dummy device that
		can be probed and supports all of the methods of WDT, but does not
		really do anything.

config WDT_ASPEED
	bool "Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 watchdog timer support"
	depends on WDT
	default y if ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Select this to enable watchdog timer for Aspeed ast2500/ast2400 devices.
	  The watchdog timer is stopped when initialized. It performs reset, either
	  full SoC reset or CPU or just some peripherals, based on the flags.
	  It currently does not support Boot Flash Addressing Mode Detection or
	  Second Boot.

config WDT_BCM6345
	bool "BCM6345 watchdog timer support"
	depends on WDT && ARCH_BMIPS
	help
	  Select this to enable watchdog timer for BCM6345 SoCs.
	  The watchdog timer is stopped when initialized.
	  It performs full SoC reset.
