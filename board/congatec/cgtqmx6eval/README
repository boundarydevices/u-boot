U-Boot for the Congatec Conga-QEVAl Evaluation Carrier board with
qmx6 quad module.

This file contains information for the port of U-Boot to the Congatec
Conga-QEVAl Evaluation Carrier board with qmx6 quad module.

1. Boot source, boot from SD card
---------------------------------

By default, the Congatec board can boot only from the SPI-NOR.
But, with the u-boot version provided with the board you can write boot
registers to force the board to reboot and boot from the SD slot. If
"bmode" command is not available from your pre-installed u-boot, these
instruction will produce the same effect:

conga-QMX6 U-Boot > mw.l 0x20d8040 0x3850
conga-QMX6 U-Boot > mw.l 0x020d8044 0x10000000
conga-QMX6 U-Boot > reset
resetting ...

The the board will reboot and, if you have written your SD correctly
the board will use u-boot that live into the SD

To copy the resulting u-boot.imx to the SD card:

 dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/xxx bs=512 seek=2

Note: Replace xxx with the device representing the SD card in your system.
