/**
 * A clock is a hardware signal that oscillates autonomously at a specific
 * frequency and duty cycle. Most hardware modules require one or more clock
 * signal to drive their operation. Clock signals are typically generated
 * externally to the HW module consuming them, by an entity this API calls a
 * clock provider. This API provides a standard means for drivers to enable and
 * disable clocks, and to set the rate at which they oscillate.
 *
 * A driver that implements UCLASS_CLOCK is a clock provider. A provider will
 * often implement multiple separate clocks, since the hardware it manages
 * often has this capability. clock_uclass.h describes the interface which
 * clock providers must implement.
 *
 * Clock consumers/clients are the HW modules driven by the clock signals. This
 * header file describes the API used by drivers for those HW modules.

/**
 * struct clk - A handle to (allowing control of) a single clock.
 *
 * Clients provide storage for clock handles. The content of the structure is
 * managed solely by the clock API and clock drivers. A clock struct is
 * initialized by "get"ing the clock struct. The clock struct is passed to all
 * other clock APIs to identify which clock signal to operate upon.
 *
 * @dev: The device which implements the clock signal.
 * @id: The clock signal ID within the provider.
 *
 * Currently, the clock API assumes that a single integer ID is enough to
 * identify and configure any clock signal for any clock provider. If this
 * assumption becomes invalid in the future, the struct could be expanded to
 * either (a) add more fields to allow clock providers to store additional
 * information, or (b) replace the id field with an opaque pointer, which the
 * provider would dynamically allocated during its .of_xlate op, and process
 * during is .request op. This may require the addition of an extra op to clean
 * up the allocation.
