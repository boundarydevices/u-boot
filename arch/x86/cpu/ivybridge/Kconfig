	  Virtual Machine Extensions are provided in many x86 CPUs. These
	  provide various facilities for allowing a host OS to provide an
	  environment where potentially several guest OSes have only
	  limited access to the underlying hardware. This is achieved
	  without resorting to software trapping and/or instruction set
	  emulation (which would be very slow).

	  Intel's implementation of this is called VT-x. This option enables
	  VT-x this so that the OS that is booted by U-Boot can make use of
	  these facilities. If this option is not enabled, then the host OS
	  will be unable to support virtualisation, or it will run very
	  slowly.
